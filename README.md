I am really lazy person, so instead of having separate repository for each project I put together selection of my most used libraries into one single maven tree.

There are three major roots:

# ee.fj.io

Input - output utiles

	- Configuration file helper
	- Password encrypted files
	- Csv / Excel files wrapper

#ee.fj.javafx

Javafx helpers

	- JavaFx FXML and controller loader

#ee.fj.l

localization and internationalization 

	- Light weight application localization helper

#ee.fj.utils

	- List of arrays columns type predictor
	- File mime types detetor
	- Java Mail wrapper

Each root contains projects themselves which are light and I tried to keep them independant as possible
